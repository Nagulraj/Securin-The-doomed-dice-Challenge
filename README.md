# Securin-The-doomed-dice-Challenge
answers for the second level of assessment

part-A (i)

Two nested for loopsâ€”one for iterating over the values of adice and another for generating corresponding values of bdice for each adice value. Introduce a count variable to keep track of the total possibilities, ie 36

part-A (ii)

similar to previous part we use two nested loops to find all the possible combination ,declare a 2 D matrix 6X6  where eachthrow of dice a and dice b is stored as tuple and the tuple is appended to the matrix.This way a 6X6 matrix is created with all the possibilities.

To print each possibilities we use two nested loops 

part-A (iii)

we use the matrix generated in the previous step,we have to find the sum of the each throw,
we use two nested loops to get tuple. declare a dictionary to store the probablility of each sum,find each sum and store it in the dicitonaryto keep track of the sum occurances.

part-A (iv)
